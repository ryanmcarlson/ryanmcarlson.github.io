## Personal Profile
Hi and welcome to my page! I'm currently an Image Analyst at Maxar working to build the globe in 3D. On the side, I am working to grow my coding profile and advance my career as a future Data Scientist. I was introduced to coding in college while completeing a dual Bachelor of Science in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Arizona. Python has always been my go-to language; now I am expanding my familiarity with other languages such as C++, R, Julia, and HTML. 

I welcome you to explore this page where I have linked some of my projects ranging from my time in college, my career, and my free-time. Also embedded are my Resume and CV, and even some of the interesting hobbies I've grown to love away from my work.

Work-life balance is incredibly important to me, as I believe it should be for everyone. Here is where I welcome you to explore my life away from the computer. 

### Everything Outdoors!
I now call Denver home, and what better place could there be to enjoy the great outdoors! I am an active hiker, climber, backpacker, and skier.

### Modern Music Culture
Music is one of my biggest passions. Most people say they listen to just about everything. However, I have come to face the truth that I listen to almost exclusively Electronic Dance Music, usually shorthanded to EDM. Now that doesn't mean I only listen to what is popular now; in fact I am always exploring the crevices of the genre, finding new and unique sounds at the bottom of the crate. Here is where I hope to build out some reviews of what I'm currently digging through.

### Bookshelf
I have made it my goal to read more, and I'd like to keep track of what has interested me. Here is where I hope to do that.
