<h1>Home</h1>
<p>
   Hi and welcome to my page!
   I'm currently an Image Analyst at Maxar working to build the globe in 3D.
   On the side, I am working to grow my coding profile and advance my career as a future Data Scientist.
   I was introduced to coding in college while completing a dual Bachelor of Science in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Arizona.
   Python has always been my go-to language; now I am expanding my familiarity with other languages such as C++, R, and Julia.
</p>
<p>
   I welcome you to explore this page where I have linked some of my projects ranging from my time in college, my career, and my free-time.
   Also embedded are my Resume and CV, and even some of the interesting hobbies I've grown to love away from my work.

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
   Work-life balance is incredibly important to me, as I believe it should be for everyone.
   Here is where I welcome you to explore my life away from the computer.
</p>

<h3><a href="/blog-outdoors/index.html">Everything Outdoors</a></h3>
<p>
   I now call Denver home, and what better place could there be to enjoy the great outdoors!
   I am an active hiker, climber, backpacker, and skier.
</p>

<h3><a href="/music.html">Modern Music Culture</a></h3>
<p>
   Music is one of my biggest passions.
   Most people say they listen to just about everything.
   However, I have come to face the truth that I listen to almost exclusively Electronic Dance Music, usually shorthanded to EDM.
   Now that doesn't mean I only listen to what is popular now; in fact I am always exploring the crevices of the genre, finding new and unique sounds at the bottom of the crate.
   Here is where I share some of what I'm currently digging through.
</p>

<h3><a href="/bookshelf.html">My Bookshelf</a></h3>
<p>
   I have made it my goal to read more, and I'd like to keep track of what has interested me.
   Here is where I hope to do that.
