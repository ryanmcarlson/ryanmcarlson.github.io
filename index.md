## Personal Profile
Hi and welcome to my page!
I'm currently an Image Analyst at Maxar working to build the globe in 3D.
On the side, I am working to grow my coding profile and advance my career as a future Data Scientist.
I was introduced to coding in college while completeing a dual Bachelor of Science in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Arizona.
Python has always been my go-to language; now I am expanding my familiarity with other languages such as C++, R, Julia, and HTML.

I welcome you to explore this page where I have linked some of my projects ranging from my time in college, my career, and my free-time.
Also embedded are my Resume and CV, and even some of the interesting hobbies I've grown to love away from my work.
